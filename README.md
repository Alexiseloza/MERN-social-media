# MERN-social-media
MERN stack social media , like instagram 

MERN project, a social network, similar to Instagram,

in order to use this project,

you must first install the dependencies using - npm install

then configure the MONGOURI with its mongo DB url, and the secret key for JWT (json web token)

also an image host like cloudinary or other similar,

you should check the components in the / client / src / component / screens folder where the fetch () is done to cloudinary and add your own data where it tells you to.

This project was created as part of a course, if you want a similar MERN type project you can contact me at alexisedgarloza@gmail.com

Thank you
